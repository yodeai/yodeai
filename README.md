Note: If wanting to run fastapi, use this line in package.json:
     "dev": "concurrently \"pnpm run next-dev\" \"pnpm run fastapi-dev\"",


## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and FastAPI as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdigitros%2Fnextjs-fastapi%2Ftree%2Fmain)

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-fastapi --example "https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

install pnpm
```bash
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

Then create the virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment use:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
and install uvicorn in the virtual enviroment:
```bash
pip install fastapi 'uvicorn[standard]'
```



Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)Â â€“ feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).

## Deploy your own

The Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project. After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be set up so that the project is usable immediately after deployment ðŸš€

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&integration-ids=oac_jUduyjQgOyzev1fjrW83NYOv)

## How to use

1. Create a [new Supabase project](https://database.new)
1. Run `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase` to create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template
1. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

### Create a Supabase client

Check out the [`/app/_examples`](./app/_examples/) folder for an example of creating a Supabase client in:

- [Client Components](./app/_examples/client-component/page.tsx)
- [Server Components](./app/_examples/server-component/page.tsx)
- [Route Handlers](./app/_examples/route-handler/route.ts)
- [Server Actions](./app/_examples/server-action/page.tsx)

### Create `todo` table and seed with data (optional)

Navigate to [your project's SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql), click `New query`, paste the contents of the [init.sql](./supabase/migrations/20230618024722_init.sql) file and click `RUN`.

This will create a basic `todos` table, enable Row Level Security (RLS), and write RLS policies enabling `select` and `insert` actions for `authenticated` users.

To seed your `todos` table with some dummy data, run the contents of the [seed.sql](./supabase/seed.sql) file.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).
