  **About Blocks and Spaces**

  Yodeai is a flexible tool for knowledge organization and synthesis. Information is stored in **blocks**, which can be either Markdown text files (like this one) or PDFs. To edit an existing block, click the edit icon in the top right corner. To create a new block, click the blue + Add block button.
  Blocks can be added to **spaces**, collections of information. Unlike traditional folders, one block can be added to multiple spaces. Within a space, you can use the chat on the right side of the screen to **ask Yodeai questions** about your information. It will learn the contents of your blocks (including the text of PDFs) to generate answers relevant to that particular space.

  **How to use your Inbox**

  New blocks will always go to your **Inbox**. This is like a space to see recent content, jog your memory, and revisit information you captured on the fly.
  Once you’ve decided what to do with a block (adding it to a space or not), you can archive it from your inbox. This will not delete the block, and it will still be visible in All Blocks and any spaces you’ve added it to.`;
