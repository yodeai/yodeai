        "description": "- **Acceptance criteria/scope:** \n\nAcceptance Criteria/Scope for User Registration Functionality:\n\n1. Non-Registered Users should be prompted with a Call to Action (CTA) to sign up when accessing the Index View.\n2. Registered Viewers should be able to vote on posts but not post or comment until they become Contributors.\n3. Contributors should have the ability to post, comment, and upvote on Product Hunt.\n4. Admins should have special privileges and access to manage the platform.\n5. Users must register with their Twitter profile, providing name, profile picture, Twitter URL, username, email address, title, and company name.\n6. Upon registration, users should automatically follow people on Product Hunt that they already follow on Twitter.\n7. Email notifications should be sent to users for daily Product Hunt digest, social re-engagement, follows, votes on their posts, comments on their posts, and replies to comments they made.\n8. The registration process should be seamless and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.\n9. User data collected during registration should be securely stored and used only for the intended purposes.\n10. The registration functionality should comply with data protection regulations and ensure user privacy.\n11. Users should have the option to update their profile information and notification preferences in the User Settings section.\n12. The registration process should be integrated with the existing architecture of Product Hunt without causing any disruptions to the platform's functionality.- **Background:** \n\nBackground information relevant for the ticket \"Create User Registration Functionality\" in the product requirement document for Product Hunt includes:\n\n- The target audience for Product Hunt includes product people, seed-stage investors, and everyday tech consumers.\n- The goal of Product Hunt is to be a community-driven platform for sharing and discovering new products and services.\n- User types on the platform include non-registered users, registered viewers, contributors (Hunters), and admins.\n- Registration for users is required and must be done through Twitter, with additional information such as email address and title/company name provided.\n- Email notifications are an essential part of user engagement, including daily digests, social re-engagement notifications, and notifications for follows, votes, comments, and replies.\n- The platform features various interactions such as submitting posts, commenting, upvoting, following users, mentioning users, and forwarding posts to specific users.\n- Future ideas for the platform include a notification feed, browser extension/bookmarklet, tweet to post functionality, email to post feature, and mobile responsiveness.\n- Competitors and product inspirations for Product Hunt include Beta List, StartupList, and TastemakerX.\n- Seeding users and content involves hand-picking initial contributors to create exclusivity and reduce spam, including recognizable product people and investors in the startup space.- **Priority level:** \n\nThe priority level for creating user registration functionality in this product requirement document would be high. This is because user registration is essential for the functionality of the platform and is a fundamental feature that needs to be implemented early on in the development process. Without user registration, users will not be able to fully engage with the platform, submit posts, comment, upvote, or receive email notifications. Therefore, ensuring that user registration functionality is implemented correctly and efficiently should be a top priority.- **In and out of scope:** \n\nIn Scope:\n- User Registration functionality\n- Registration with Twitter\n- Pulling in user information from Twitter (name, profile pic, Twitter URL, username)\n- Additional user information required (email address, title, company name)\n\nOut of Scope:\n- Detailed implementation of other features such as post submissions, comments, voting, email notifications, etc.\n- User interactions beyond registration\n- Seeding users and content\n- Competitors and product inspiration\n- Tech notes\n- Go to market strategies\n- Post-launch marketing\n- Future ideas\n- Seeding users and content- **User story:** \n\nAs a new user, I want to be able to register with my Twitter profile and provide additional information such as my email address, title, and company name so that I can start engaging with the Product Hunt community by submitting posts, commenting, and upvoting products.- **Technical considerations:** \n\nSome technical considerations relevant to creating user registration functionality in this product requirement document include:\n\n1. Integration with Twitter API: Since users are required to register with their Twitter profile, the system will need to integrate with the Twitter API to pull in user information such as name, profile picture, and Twitter username.\n\n2. User Data Storage: The system will need to store user data such as name, username, image, headline, email address, title, and company name. This data will need to be securely stored and managed.\n\n3. Email Notifications: The system will need to send out email notifications to users for various events such as daily digests, social re-engagement, follows, votes, comments, and replies. This will require setting up an email notification system.\n\n4. User Types and Permissions: The system will need to differentiate between non-registered users, registered viewers, contributors, and admins. Each user type will have different permissions and capabilities within the platform.\n\n5. User Interaction Features: The system will need to support user interactions such as submitting posts, commenting on posts, upvoting posts, following users, mentioning users, and forwarding posts to specific users. These features will require robust backend functionality.\n\n6. Registration Flow: The registration process should be seamless and user-friendly, integrating with Twitter for easy signup. The system should also automatically follow users on Product Hunt that the user already follows on Twitter.\n\n7. Data Deduplication: Consideration should be given to deduplicating URLs to prevent multiple submissions of the same link. This will help maintain the quality of content on the platform.\n\n8. Future Ideas and Scalability: The system should be designed with future scalability in mind, considering features such as notification feeds, browser extensions, tweet to post functionality, email to post functionality, and mobile responsiveness.\n\nBy addressing these technical considerations, the user registration functionality can be successfully implemented in the Product Hunt platform, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.- **Design field:** \n\nBased on the product requirement document provided, here are some UX details and reference mockups for creating the User Registration functionality:\n\n1.
